# TURSEM (Turkish Regional Seas Ecosystem Model)

The TURSEM model is an advanced modified version of the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) tailored to simulate the unique environmental conditions of the Black Sea. Recognizing the region's distinct anoxic zones, TURSEM integrates the Benthic Redox Model (BROM) to accurately represent the biogeochemical processes occurring under low oxygen conditions. This coupling of ERSEM with BROM allows TURSEM to provide a detailed and realistic simulation of the Black Sea's ecosystem, addressing the specific challenges posed by its anoxic environment.
